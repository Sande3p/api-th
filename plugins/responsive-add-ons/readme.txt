== Description ==

This plugin has been designed specifically for <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive</a> but will also work on any theme. Wordpress is working with theme
developers like <a href="http://cyberchimps.com" title="CyberChimps">CyberChimps.com</a> to make sure that the theme's functionality is limited to design,
layout and structure and that anything that falls outside of this is developed as a plugin. Hence the reason why this plugin has been developed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `responsive-add-ons.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why have the Webmaster options moved to a plugin? =

Wordpress is very keen (as we are) to separate functionality from design. Among other things it keeps themes from being bloated, it's cleaner code wise and allows users to choose what features they
 want.

= Will it work for any theme? =

The short answer is yes. The long answer is that whilst we have created this primarily for our <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive</a> theme we decided
that it was important to make it inclusive rather than exclusive.
